This assignment is to create a KryptoJobs2Go web platform so that customer can take a look and pay with ethereum cryptocurrency for the purpose of hiring fintech professionals.

Here is the general outlook of my web platform by using streamlit library:

The main screen display the list of Fintech Professionals basic information(name, Ethereum Account address, Rating and Hourly rate per Ether)

The sidebar on the left is for customer to pick the Fintech Professionals based on your favourite and demand. You can select the person you like, number of hours you need, then it will display the total wage you would need to pay.
